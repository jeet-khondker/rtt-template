# Frontend Setup

The purpose of this file is to document the workflow of setting up the frontend Application. ReactJS is the Frontend UI Library that will be used in the `project` Application.

## ReactJS Application Setup Integrated with TypeScript

```sh
yarn create react-app frontend --template typescript
```

## Running the ReactJS Application (Client) Server

```sh
yarn start
```

## Client Server Execution URL Endpoint

> Client Server will be executing on another port other than `3000` because Database Server (JSON Server) is using the port `3000`.

```sh
http://localhost:3001/
```
